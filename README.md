# coderdojo-pygame

Example games in PyGame Zero for Brighton Coder Dojo.

My aim is produce examples that are good enough to inspire kids, but not too good that they are satisfying to play, yet. That's where the kids come in: there is plenty of room for improvement to make them into proper playable games. 

## Install

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```
python3 pong1.py
```

## More info

The games come from my other repo: https://github.com/ericclack/geekclub
